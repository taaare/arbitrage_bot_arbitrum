simple-arbitrage-arbitrum
================
This repository contains a simple, mechanical system for discovering, evaluating, rating, and submitting arbitrage opportunities to the Flashbots bundle endpoint. This script is very unlikely to be profitable, as many users have access to it, and it is targeting well-known Ethereum opportunities.

I modified the simple-arbitrage repository in order to allow for its use on Arbitrum when the network was in it's early stages. Due to the simple nature of the arbitrage method, this bot generates very little revenue. However, this could be used as a basis for a more complex arbitrage bot. Given deeper analysis of decentralized exchange markets & while using more fleshed-out risk models, optimal arbitrage pathing, and multi-dex routing, it can be made more profitable. See https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.03380

Yes, I know the private key to the wallet is *somewhere* in this repo. <3 github repo scrapers

Environment Variables
=====================
- **ETHEREUM_RPC_URL** - Ethereum RPC endpoint. Can not be the same as FLASHBOTS_RPC_URL
- **PRIVATE_KEY** - Private key for the Ethereum EOA that will be submitting Flashbots Ethereum transactions
- **FLASHBOTS_RELAY_SIGNING_KEY** _[Optional, default: random]_ - Flashbots submissions require an Ethereum private key to sign transaction payloads. This newly-created account does not need to hold any funds or correlate to any on-chain activity, it just needs to be used across multiple Flashbots RPC requests to identify requests related to same searcher. Please see https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-auction/searchers/faq#do-i-need-authentication-to-access-the-flashbots-relay
- **HEALTHCHECK_URL** _[Optional]_ - Health check URL, hit only after successfully submitting a bundle.
- **MINER_REWARD_PERCENTAGE** _[Optional, default 80]_ - 0 -> 100, what percentage of overall profitability to send to miner.

Usage
======================
1. Generate a new bot wallet address and extract the private key into a raw 32-byte format.
2. Deploy the included BundleExecutor.sol to Ethereum, from a secured account, with the address of the newly created wallet as the constructor argument
3. Transfer WETH to the newly deployed BundleExecutor

_It is important to keep both the bot wallet private key and bundleExecutor owner private key secure. The bot wallet attempts to not lose WETH inside an arbitrage, but a malicious user would be able to drain the contract._
